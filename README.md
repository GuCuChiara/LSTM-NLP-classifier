Text classification using LSTMs with TensorFlow 2.0

NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.

It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corporate and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active discussion forum.

Category classification, for news, is a multi-tag text classification problem.

The goal is to assign one or more categories to a news article.

Know the facts:

We received data, consisting of 5 categories in total.

The five categories we want to identify are:
